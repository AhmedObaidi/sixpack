Building a Sixpack Client is pretty straight forward, though there are some basic standards we'd like you to follow.

Clients:

* Are responsible for generating and storing (in a cookie, session, MySQL, Redis, etc) unique client ids for each user.
* should pass IP addresses and User Agents to Sixpack to avoid bots from participating in tests (where applicable)
* should have a consistant interface
    * helper methods that make using sixpack extremely easy in a templating language
    * convert and participate methods
* should gracefull handle server errors and responses
